The application's database is a frequent target for attackers because it typically contains interesting/critical data.  ## What Is a SQL Injection Attack?

If database queries use this coding style, the database will always distinguish between code and data, regardless of what user input is supplied.

For example, on MS SQL Server, you have three main default roles: `db_datareader`, `db_datawriter` and `db_owner`. Before stored procedures came into use, DBAs would give `db_datareader` or `db_datawriter` rights to the webservice's user, depending on the requirements.

The `sp_getAccountBalance` stored procedure has to be predefined in the database and use the same functionality as the query above.  ```java // This should REALLY be validated String custname = request.getParameter(\"customerName\"); try {   CallableStatement cs = connection.prepareCall(\"{call"

This is a very standard need in dynamic query creation.

More techniques on how to implement strong input validation is described in the [Input Validation Cheat Sheet](Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.md).  ### Defense Option 4: STRONGLY DISCOURAGED: Escaping All User-Supplied Input  In this approach, the developer will escape all user input before putting it in a query.

That way, the designer of the application can have good granularity in the access control, thus reducing the privileges as much as possible.

Then the implicit `eval` of `setTimeout` reverses another layer of JavaScript encoding to pass the correct value to `customFunction`  The reason why you only need to double JavaScript encode is that the `customFunction` function did not itself pass the input to another method which implicitly or explicitly called `eval` If *firstName* was passed to another JavaScript method which implicitly or explicitly called `eval()` then `<%=doubleJavaScriptEncodedData%>` above would need to be changed to `<%=tripleJavaScriptEncodedData%>`.

Instead use `JSON.toJSON()` and `JSON.parse()` (Chris Schmidt).  ## Common Problems Associated with Mitigating DOM Based XSS  ### Complex Contexts  In many cases the context isn't always straightforward to discern.  ```html <a href=\"javascript:myFunction('<%=untrustedData%>', 'test');\">Click Me</a>  ... <script> Function myFunction (url,name) {     window.location = url; }"

Because the data was introduced in JavaScript code and passed to a URL subcontext the appropriate server-side encoding would be the following:  ```html <a href=\"javascript:myFunction('<%=ESAPI.encoder().encodeForJavascript(ESAPI.encoder().encodeForURL(untrustedData)) %>', 'test');\"> Click Me</a>  ... ```  Or if you were using ECMAScript 5 with an immutable JavaScript client-side encoding"

This logically seems to be prudent advice as the JavaScript parser does not understand HTML encoding.  However, if the pages returned from your web application utilize a content type of `text/xhtml` or the file type extension of `*.xhtml` then HTML encoding may not work to mitigate against XSS.

MITRE began researching data sources and analytic processes within FMX for detecting advanced persistent threats (APTs) more quickly under an “assume breach” mentality. Cyber game exercises were conducted on a periodic basis to emulate adversaries within the heavily monitored environment and threat hunting was performed to test analytic hypotheses against the data collected.

The change was driven by the need to fix some of the technique abstraction level issues that occurred as ATT&CK grew over the years. Some techniques were very broad and some were narrow, only describing a very specific behavior. The imbalance that this led to created unintended consequences that made it not only difficult to visualize ATT&CK, but also hard to understand the purpose"

ATT&CK provides details on 100+ threat actor groups, including the techniques and software they are known to use.1 ATT&CK can be used to identify defensive gaps, assess security tool capabilities, organize detections, hunt for threats, engage in red team activities, or validate mitigation controls.

CISA created this guide with the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute™ (HSSEDI), a DHS-owned federally funded research and development center (FFRDC), which worked with the MITRE ATT&CK team. ATT&CK Levels ATT&CK describes behaviors across the adversary lifecycle, commonly known as tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). In ATT&CK, these behaviors correspond to four increasingly granular levels: 1. Tactics represent the “what” and “why” of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. They are the adversary’s technical goals, the reason for performing an action, and what they are trying to achieve. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access"

Note: The ATT&CK framework is not intended to be interpreted as linear—with the adversary moving through the tactics in a straight line (i.e., left to right) in order to accomplish their goal.2 Additionally, an adversary does not need to use all of the ATT&CK tactics in order to achieve their operational goals. 2. Techniques represent “how” an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access.

Note: many of the techniques within ATT&CK include legitimate system functions that can be used for malicious purposes (referred to as “living off the land”). 3. Sub-techniques provide more granular descriptions of techniques. For example, there are behaviors under the OS Credential Dumping [T1003] technique that describe specific methods to perform the technique, such as accessing LSASS Memory [T1003.001], Security Account Manager [T1003.002], or /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow [TT1003.008].

They can be useful for replication of an incident with adversary emulation and for specifics on how to detect that instance in use. 1 Not every adversary behavior is documented in ATT&CK. 2 For example, after Initial Access [TA0001] and during an operation, the adversary may exfiltrate data (Exfiltration [TA0010]) and then implement additional persistence mechanisms (Persistence [TA0003]), switching tactics from right to left.

Despite these great resources, it felt like most of the material out there either introduced what ATT&CK is or dove deeply into advanced topics around ATT&CK. But what if you’re just taking your first steps with it? That’s why during summer 2019 we decided to write a series of blog posts around getting started with ATT&CK.

This book started as a series of blog posts aimed at answering that question for four key use cases:  threat intelligence  detection and analytics  adversary emulation and red teaming  assessment and engineering We reorganized our website to share content based on these use cases, and our hope is these blog posts will add to those resources.

Translate the behavior into a tactic—Consider the adversary’s technical goal for that behavior and choose a tactic that fits. The good news: there are only 12 tactics to choose from in Enterprise ATT&CK.

This is what makes adversary emulation different from penetration testing and other forms of red teaming. Adversary emulators construct a scenario to test certain aspects of an adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The red team then follows the scenario while operating on a target network to test how defenses might fare against the emulated adversary.

Additionally, if you find an analytic that covers a particular technique, instead of just marking that the technique is covered, you’ll want to tease out that analytic’s coverage fidelity as well. Tip: For each analytic, we recommend finding what it’s keying in on and seeing how that maps back to ATT&CK. As an example, you might have an analytic that looks at a specific Windows event; to determine this analytic’s coverage, you can look up the event ID in the Windows ATT&CK Logging Cheat Sheet or a similar repository.

To do this, we recommend iterating through each tool—creating a separate heatmap for each— and asking the following questions:  Where does the tool run? Depending on where a tool is running—e.g., at the perimeter or on each endpoint—it may do better or worse with specific tactics.  How does the tool detect? Is it using a static set of “known bad” indicators? Or is it doing something behavioral?  What data sources does the tool monitor?

Start building analytics and updating your coverage chart. START WITH YOUR CURRENT COVERAGE, ADD ANALYTICS, AND UPDATE YOUR COVERAGE ACCORDINGLY You may also want to start upgrading your tools.

This helps move your assessment away from just looking at tools and analytics and what they’re detecting to looking at your SOC as a whole. A good way to identify how you’re mitigating techniques is to go through each of your SOC’s policies, preventative tools, and security controls, then map them to the ATT&CK technique(s) they may impact, and then add those techniques to your heatmap of coverage. Our recent restructuring of mitigations allows you to go through each mitigation and see the techniques it’s mapped to.

Example: If you previously found a tool that has a lot of ATT&CK-related capabilities, but personnel are only using it to monitor the Windows Registry, then you should modify that tool’s heatmap to better reflect how it’s being used. As you talk to your colleagues, look at the tool heatmaps you had previously created. If you’re still not satisfied with the coverage your tools are providing, it may be necessary to evaluate new ones. Come up with a heatmap of coverage for each prospective new tool and see how adding it helps enhance your coverage.

Lastly, you may be able to decrease your reliance on tools and analytics by implementing more mitigations. Look at mitigations in ATT&CK to gauge if you can practically implement them. Consult your detection heatmap as part of this process; if there’s a high-cost mitigation that’ll prevent a technique that you’re doing a good job of detecting, it may not be a good trade-off. On the other hand, if there are low-cost mitigations you can implement for techniques that you’re struggling to write analytics for, then implementing them might be a good use of"

Detection and mitigation should both be used as tools for effective coverage. SUMMARY Assessing your defenses and guiding your engineering can be a great way to get started with ATT&CK.

The original goals were modest—to help people and enterprises focus their attention and get started on the most important steps to defend themselves from the attacks that really mattered. Led by the Center for Internet Security® (CIS®), the CIS Controls have matured into an international community of volunteer individuals and institutions that: • Share insights into attacks and attackers, identify root causes, and translate that into classes of"

Evolution of the CIS Controls The CIS Controls started like many similar activities; we gathered experts together, and shared and argued until we reached an agreement. This can be very valuable, depending on the people at the table and their experience.

At CIS, we have been on a multi-year path to bring more data, rigor, and transparency to the process of best practice recommendations (the CIS Benchmarks™ and the CIS Controls).

Enterprises, especially small ones, could struggle with some of the early Safeguards and never get around to implementing later CIS Controls (for example, having a backup strategy to help recover from ransomware). As a result, starting with Version 7.1, we created CIS Controls Implementation Groups (IGs) as our recommended new guidance to prioritize implementation.
